Merge conflict - it's when multiple contributors (2 people) changed same file.

To resolve conflict, we can do couple things:
    1. Stash changes (if you didn't finish, and you cannot combine changes, stash your changes.
                      In this case, you are not loosing changes forever.)

    2. Discard your changes (you are losing your changes forever)
        either git checkout file or git reset --hard

    3. Resolve conflict
        first of all we have to commit our changes
        then pull
        and check conflicting files (fix manually or through other tools, like intellij)
        accept theirs changes
        accept yours (your changes)
        merge changes (compromise)

        once conflict resolved, we can commit and push changes to githib.

    4. Just clone project again and copy paste your changes
        (No, but this is what people usually do)

Git Branches
        What is branch?
            It's one version of your project.
            With git, we can have multiple version of project that exist in parallel.
            Every branch can have independent commits history.
