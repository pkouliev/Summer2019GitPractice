 error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:

 Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
 Aborting

 Because I modified a file that was changed by someone else me, I cannot pull updates.
 This situation calls merge conflict.

    There are 3 solutions:

    1. Stash changes. It's when you save your changes on a side.
       Then, you can apply your changes again after pull.

    2. Discard changes. It's pretty much loss of your updates.
       If some file/files conflicts, you can discard your updates and pull code successfully.

    3. Resolve merge conflict right away.
